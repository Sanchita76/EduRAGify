3. **Set up Streamlit secrets**: ⚠️

    For secure handling of your credentials, use Streamlit secrets. In your project directory, create a `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file and add your credentials as follows:

    ```toml
    # secrets.toml
    SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT = "your_snowflake_account"
    SNOWFLAKE_USER = "your_snowflake_user"
    SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD = "your_snowflake_password"

    SNOWFLAKE_SCHEMA = "your_snowflake_schema"
    CORTEX_SEARCH_SERVICE = "your_cortex_search_service"
    ```

    **Important**: Make sure your `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file is not committed to your version control system. Add `.streamlit/` to your `.gitignore` file to keep your credentials secure.
